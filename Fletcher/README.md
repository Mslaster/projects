#Project Fletcher    

##Background    
For this project, the goal was to do some data exploration on text data using an unsupervised algorithm. 
Initially, I sought to do a much more comprehensive project exploring the condition called [hypergraphia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraphia), said to afflict many famous writers. 
The disorder is characterized by an obsessive urge to write. I wanted to compare the writing styles of alleged hypergraphic authors to those contemporaries of the same genre.
However, I realized that far more clinical knowledge would have been necessary to understand in which direction to go.
So, instead, I decided to investigate the works of one particular writer rumored to be afflicted with hypergraphia, Edgar Allen Poe.
Since Poe is known to have widely variable [themes] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe#Literary_style_and_themes) in his writings, I wanted to see if there was some way to capture them. The notebook containing my code is over [here](Poe Edited.ipynb), and the accompanying slides are [here] (Poelarity.pdf).   

##Process    
I culled 66 short stories written by Poe, which is available at Project Gutenberg. I chose to limit it to short stories for consistency in the type of documents modeled on.
I used removed stop-words and used SKlearn's count vectorizer to change each story into a count vector. Next, I tried to use LDA topic modeling to find distinct topics.
There's an interesting design question inherent in topic modeling: how many topics to model on? Generally, the answer is subjective, choosing however many produce what appear to be meaningful distinct topics.
I wanted to try to find some method to try to "capture" the right number more objectively.    

So, I had the following intuition: I'd assume that an individual topic will contain a generally consistent emotive tone, calculated by TextBlob's sentiment analysis.
However, different topics will generally differ from one another in emotive tone. If I were to assume too few topics, when weighing the polarity of the most common words per topic, they would not vary too much since each topic would contain so many varied words. 
On the other hand, if I chose too many topics, each one would be cut down to too few words to capture any significant emotive tone. So, there must be some "middle ground" where there are enough topics to capture varied sentiments yet not too many to "water down" each one.
Optimizing for standard deviation, I found this to indeed be true:

Clearly, the standard deviation of topic polarity increases as more topics are added and but dips as it gets higher. The most varied model contains 12 topics, so I decided to select that as the optimal one.
When looking at the most common words of the models, I found many of them to be pretty coherent. One topic included words describing death philosophically like, *"long death yet spirit life soul within character condition shadow spoke thus days things feeling never lips sense memory fancy died earth god body evil"*    
Another had these words about art and nature, *"one beauty yet art seen valley light scene young hundred character green ellison whose love sense flowers magnificent form became trees eye less sentiment color"*    

##Future Considerations
I decided to try to come up with an optimal topic count using scores generated by TextBlob's sentiment analysis. I realize that this approach has limitations for several reasons. First, many words register as 0 on its scale as neutral, so it does not really capture too much "flavor" of any given topic. Also, as language is dynamic, it's not always to helpful to analyze a 150 year old text based on TextBlob's model, which is trained on more contemporary work. Finally, I have to confess to limited domain knowledge of Poe's writings. More background would allow me to more properly assess the meaningfulness of each topic.
